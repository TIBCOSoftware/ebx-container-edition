# Examples

This directory contains some configuration or chart examples to deploy ebx with different databases type or for different
kubernetes distro.

If a chart is present in one of the above example, that means it's a modification of the ebx-generic chart and you 
will have to use it.

Otherwise you can use the ebx-generic chart and just follow the proposed configuration.
